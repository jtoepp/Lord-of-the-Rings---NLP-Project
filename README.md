# Exploring NLP Methods with The Lord of The Rings
## Inspiration
I have been a huge fan of all of Tolkien's works since I first read the Lord of the Rings trilogy at 10 years old. However, reading the books is far different than listening to them. With the audiobooks, I notice Tolkien's patterns of writing more, and how that changes throughout the Silmarillion and The Hobbit as compared to the original trilogy. Shortly after I was noticing these patterns, I heard [this podcast](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2019/text-mining-in-r) that connected the dots: an NLP project regarding The Lord of The Rings, and, if I can find the data, expand to Tolkien's full works.
